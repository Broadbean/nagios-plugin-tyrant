Very basic nagios plugin for a Tokyo Tyrant RDB database (http://fallabs.com/tokyotyrant/)

Requires Nagios::Plugin & Time::HiRes from CPAN and TokyoTyrant perl module from http://fallabs.com/tokyotyrant/perlpkg/

Checks the following:
 * tyrant is available & you can read/write to it
 * if tyrant is a slave it will check that replication is working
 * optionally warn if there are too many records in tyrant
 * optionally warn if the server load average goes above a number of your choice
